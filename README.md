# Music City Code 2016

## Native mobile apps beyond Hello World
These are the materials from my Music City Code 2016 talk.

### Examples

Explore the `Examples` directory for a few example applications.

- **MCCPlugins** - this is the example application that demonstrates using Xamarin.Forms with the Connectivity and Notifier plugins.
- **CoolFeatures** - this is an example application that demonstrates using the plugin I made called _Plugin.FeatureTracking_. The plugin is already included with this example app in `/packages`.

### Bait-and-Switch Plugin

Explore the `BaitAndSwitch_Plugin` directory to review information concerning plugins created using the bait-and-switch approach. 

> _Note - these plugins aren't published on NuGet._ 

- **Plugin.FeatureTracking** - source code for my _Plugin.FeatureTracking_ plugin that was created using the bait-and-switch approach.
